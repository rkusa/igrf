# International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF)

International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) implementation in pure Rust. This is a port of https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html (and https://github.com/nsdecicco/libgeomag).

**Status:** Not well tested, needs another improvement pass to get rid off possible index out of bounds panics.
